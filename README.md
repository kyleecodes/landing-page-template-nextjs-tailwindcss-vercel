This is a template for a simple, responsive, fast landing page using JavaScript, NextJS, Tailwindcss, and Vercel. 
Template is based on my [Communal Tech](https://www.communaltech.com/) landing page.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies: 

```
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Making Changes

1. Add your links for the `NavBar.js` and `SocialLinks.js` components
2. Update your html metatags in `index.js`, `about.js`, and `socials.js`
3. Replace Lorem Ipsum text with your own text
4. Configure your dark and light color themes in `globals.css`
5. Update your favicon and replace placekitten picture with your own in `index.js`
6. To change the default fonts, update reference on line 20 in `_document.js` to import your desired font. Then, update tailwindcss of your new font under line 11 in `tailwind.config.js`. You can also apply fonts inline using Tailwindcss.

Made this template on a whim, so it could use more comments.
Do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. :)

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
